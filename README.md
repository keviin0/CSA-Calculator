- TicTacToe

This UI TicTacToe game simulates an actual game of TicTacToe. The game requires that there are two people, obviously, so there are two different symbols that the players can choose from, either a X or an O. The player who chooses X is told that they are first; in order to choose a spot to place their symbol, the player uses their mouse to click near the center of one of the nine boxes. Their spot has been selected, so now it's time for the second player to select a spot, following the same procedure with the mouse that the first player did. This process continues until a player wins, which is when they place three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The UI will notify the players when one of them has won. If neither player wins, the UI will notify the players that it's a draw.
