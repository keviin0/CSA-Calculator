--------Student Self Evaluations and Reflections:

I believe that I should get a 5/5 on my self-grade. I spent time outside of class searching for specific information for my code outside the resources provided to us in class, which included me going to the library to get a book on Java. I had learned from my last project that I should research the types of syntax and concepts I need and to plan out my code before just writing code and trying to learn along the way. I was able to overcome many issues on Intellij. Initially, I could not even commit my changes to my code. One time, an attempted commit ended up deleting my entire code. However, that may have been a good thing because I realized I could find a more efficient method to create my card deck for my War Card Game. Eventually, with the help of my team, I was able to create and push my code properly, which resulted in many changes I myself made to my code. However, when it came to creating a button that would appear on the main menu screen for the actual running of this project, I used the same style of text to create a button my team did, and I tried altering many parts of my code, but a button on the main menu screen still does not appear and IntelliJ pushed a certain part of my code in the wrong place in github. I commented on my original code and commit to show what my intended code was supposed to be. This is an issue I plan on resolving this weekend and in the beginning of next week. Otherwise, I believe I most likely created a functioning card deck, but I commented out my final changes because I wasn't entirely sure if they were correct, and I did not want to create any "rubber chickens" in the code that would hurt my group.

For my self grade, I believe that I should get a 5/5. I set a goal for myself to finish a TicTacToe mini game by the end of the week, which I accomplished. It was no easy task, though. Since I'm still learning IntelliJ, I had to spend a lot of time playing with the IDE to get it to work with my code. I have also never used JPanel in Java, so I had to climb a steep learning curve for that as well. I faced many syntactical, as well as logical errors, but I was able to problem solve to get to my end result. Overall, I think I contributed quite a lot to the team, since I made a whole mini game for our project.

--------Explanation for Each Lab:

- Calculator UI

- Thai21

- TicTacToe

This UI TicTacToe game simulates an actual game of TicTacToe. The game requires that there are two people, obviously, so there are two different symbols that the players can choose from, either a X or an O. The player who chooses X is told that they are first; in order to choose a spot to place their symbol, the player uses their mouse to click near the center of one of the nine boxes. Their spot has been selected, so now it's time for the second player to select a spot, following the same procedure with the mouse that the first player did. This process continues until a player wins, which is when they place three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal. The UI will notify the players when one of them has won. If neither player wins, the UI will notify the players that it's a draw.
